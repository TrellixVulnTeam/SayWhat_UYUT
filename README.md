Say What takes either a text or audio input (through the Mozilla Web Speech API) and parses it to return the sentiment of that text through a numeric score. In addition, the app also detects people and locations mentioned in the text (through Google's Natural Language API) and returns clickable links to their Wikipedia pages. 

Say What can be useful to parse neutrality of news articles and provide more information for users to learn more about the people and places mentioned.
